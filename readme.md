## Day 1: 02/08/2021

 Extremely excited to be apart of this program. I am a current sophomore studying statistics at penn/wharton with 
 interests in quantitative finance and product management. From this program, I hope to be able to understand and apply
 deep learning algorithims to various project ideas that I have. I'm also excited for the makeathon and can't wait to
 apply what I learn from this program into practice!
 
 ## Day 2: 02/09/2021
 
 I had great time meeting my mentor Wesley and the rest of my team! I'm excited for what the coming weeks will bring 
 and the work that we will do together. 
 
The introduction to the scikit-learn library was very interesting as well. From which I the two main 
discussions that were had were:
 - #### Question 1, The differences between supervised and unsupervised learning:
    - Supervised Learning is where a program is trained on a pre defined set of examples, and
    then is used to make accurate conclusions when given new data
    - Unsupervised Learning is where a program is essentially finding relationships and patterns
    from the actual raw data itself  
 - #### Question 2, Scikit-Learn and data visualization
    - Scikit-learn does not have the power to conduct data visualization on its own, it must be 
    accompanied with another library such as matplotlib or seaborn to visual data 
    - Scikit-learn is focused strictly on focused on training ml algorithims, and does not contain
    any modules for data visualization
